    "*Why should we care about coral?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Coral reefs are **critical to the marine ecosystem**, with about **25% of marine life** depending on the habitats they create. Furthermore, over **500 million people** worldwide **rely on reefs for food, tourism, and employment**, with coral reefs providing protection from extreme weather events and contributing nearly **$30 billion** in estimated value (TIME, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is coral bleaching, and why is it a concern?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their importance, coral reefs are increasingly threatened by a phenomenon known as **coral bleaching**. Coral bleaching occurs when corals, stressed by changes in environmental conditions‚Äîmost notably increased **sea surface temperatures (SSTs)**‚Äîexpel the symbiotic algae (*zooxanthellae*) that live within their tissues. These algae are crucial to the coral's survival, as they provide energy through **photosynthesis** and contribute to the coral's vibrant colors. The loss of these algae causes the corals to turn white or \"bleach\" and significantly increases their susceptibility to **disease** and **mortality** (Hughes et al., 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "*What causes coral bleaching?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary driver of coral bleaching is **thermal stress** due to elevated SSTs. Even small increases in SSTs, such as **1¬∞C above the normal maximum temperatures**, can lead to widespread bleaching events, particularly when these elevated temperatures persist for extended periods (Baker, Glynn, & Riegl, 2008). Additional stressors, such as **pollution**, **overfishing**, and **ocean acidification**, can exacerbate the effects of thermal stress, making it more difficult for corals to recover from bleaching events (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017; Loya et al., 2001).\n",
    "\n",
    "*How has coral bleaching changed over time?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few decades, the **frequency** and **severity** of coral bleaching events have increased significantly, largely driven by **global climate change** (Hughes et al., 2017). As ocean temperatures continue to rise, the future of coral reefs is increasingly uncertain, with projections suggesting that most coral reefs could experience **annual severe bleaching** by the mid-21st century (Pandolfi et al., 2011). The potential loss of coral reefs would have profound implications not only for **marine ecosystems** but also for human communities that depend on the goods and services provided by healthy coral reefs (Eakin et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "*What can be done to address coral bleaching?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the environmental conditions that lead to coral bleaching, such as **sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA)** and **thermal stress anomalies (TSA)**, is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of future bleaching events (Spalding, Ravilious, & Green, 2001). By studying these factors, researchers can develop **early warning systems**, inform **conservation strategies**, and guide efforts to reduce the **anthropogenic stressors** that further endanger coral reefs (Brown, 1997). Addressing coral bleaching is not only a matter of preserving **biodiversity** but is also critical for maintaining the **resilience** and **sustainability** of marine environments and the human economies that depend on them.\n",

    "The objective of this notebook is to develop a robust predictive model for coral bleaching severity using a comprehensive dataset. The workflow is divided into several key stages, each contributing to the final goal of creating a high-performing model through exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model training. Here's a brief overview of each section:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  \n",
    "   This section focuses on cleaning and understanding the dataset. We remove irrelevant columns, handle missing values and duplicates, and standardize the data for consistency. The exploration phase also involves generating insights to inform feature engineering and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**:  \n",
    "   To prepare the data for modeling, we encode categorical variables, engineer new features, apply clustering to geographical data, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. This stage also includes scaling and normalization techniques to ensure that the model handles the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:  \n",
    "   In this stage, we evaluate various machine learning models, perform initial training, and validate their performance. We further fine-tune the models using hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Random Search and Bayesian Search to improve their predictive accuracy. The best model is selected based on performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Findings Summary and Conclusion**:  \n",
    "   The final section summarizes the key findings from the analysis, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. The notebook concludes with insights into the performance of the models and recommendations for future improvements."

    "\n",
    "- **Percent Bleaching vs TSA (Temperature Stress Anomaly) (Top Left):**\n",
    "    - The scatter plot shows an **increasing trend** in percent bleaching as **TSA** values rise from negative to positive.\n",
    "    - When TSA values are below zero, bleaching is low, with a gradual rise as TSA approaches zero.\n",
    "    - As TSA becomes positive, bleaching increases significantly, especially when TSA exceeds **0**, indicating that elevated temperatures contribute to more severe bleaching events.\n",
    "    - The curve steepens after TSA values reach 0, suggesting that small positive anomalies can lead to large bleaching percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percent Bleaching vs TSA Maximum (Top Right):**\n",
    "    - The plot shows an **initial increase** in bleaching with **TSA Maximum** but then **flattens and slightly declines** after reaching a threshold (around 6-7 on the TSA Maximum scale).\n",
    "    - This plateau effect may indicate that corals have experienced a critical level of temperature stress beyond which further stress does not lead to proportionally higher bleaching, potentially due to coral mortality or other limiting factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percent Bleaching vs TSA Frequency (Bottom Left):**\n",
    "    - The relationship between **TSA Frequency** and bleaching is an **inverted-U shape**: bleaching increases with more frequent temperature stress events but then declines at higher frequencies.\n",
    "    - This suggests that after a certain point, more frequent stress events may not lead to further bleaching, possibly due to coral adaptation or death.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percent Bleaching vs TSA DHW (Degree Heating Weeks) (Bottom Right):**\n",
    "    - The relationship between **TSA DHW** and bleaching shows an **increase followed by a plateau or decline**. This pattern is similar to TSA Maximum and Frequency, indicating that prolonged heat stress leads to bleaching up to a point, after which additional stress does not cause further bleaching.\n",
    "    - This may be due to corals already experiencing severe damage or mortality at high DHW values.\n",

    "üìù <strong>General Insights:</strong>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Nonlinear Relationships:</strong> All four plots show nonlinear trends, indicating that the relationship between TSA metrics and bleaching is complex. In most cases, bleaching increases with stress but eventually plateaus or declines.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Bleaching Plateaus at Higher Stress:</strong> Several plots exhibit a saturation effect, where higher levels or frequencies of stress do not result in more bleaching, likely due to factors such as coral mortality or adaptation.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Impact of TSA Metrics:</strong> Small deviations in TSA, frequent stress events, and prolonged heat stress (as seen in TSA DHW) can lead to significant bleaching, though the impact levels off at extreme values, suggesting the need to account for multiple factors when assessing coral stress.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The four scatter plots demonstrate the **complex relationship** between temperature stress metrics and coral bleaching. While increases in temperature stress generally lead to more bleaching, there is a **threshold effect** where bleaching does not continue to increase indefinitely with more frequent or extreme temperature anomalies. These results underscore the importance of considering various aspects of temperature stress, including anomaly size, frequency, and duration, to fully understand their impact on coral health."

    "    - The **TSA Maximum** (green line) remains relatively stable over time, fluctuating between **2.5 K** and **3.5 K** across the years. This suggests that short-term thermal stress events remain consistent, with no significant long-term upward trend.\n",
    "    - While the TSA Maximum shows consistent patterns, it doesn‚Äôt reach extreme values, suggesting that prolonged and chronic heat stress might be more critical for coral bleaching than short-term extremes.\n",

    "    - The **TSA Frequency** (orange line) shows significant fluctuations, particularly in the early **1980s** and **1990s**, where it reached peaks of **6-8 events**. However, it stabilizes after **2000**, indicating fewer frequent heat stress events in recent years.\n",

    "    - While TSA DHW has seen reductions post-**2000**, it remains a critical variable in the early years, showing that extended periods of elevated temperatures significantly contributed to bleaching events during those times.\n",

These peaks in bleaching are linked to periods of high heat stress, confirming that prolonged and frequent thermal stress events are primary drivers of coral bleaching.  \n",

    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Bleaching:</strong> There is a <strong>clear correlation</strong> between rising SST and coral bleaching. Bleaching severity significantly increases when SST exceeds <strong>300 K (~27¬∞C)</strong>, indicating a critical temperature threshold beyond which coral reefs experience significant stress. SST and SST anomalies (SSTA) are key drivers of coral bleaching, particularly in regions like the <strong>Caribbean</strong>, <strong>Red Sea</strong>, and <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Sustained Thermal Stress:</strong> Prolonged exposure to high temperatures, measured through <strong>Degree Heating Weeks (DHW)</strong>, strongly correlates with bleaching. Reefs in the <strong>Caribbean</strong> and <strong>Indo-Pacific</strong> regions, which experience frequent and prolonged thermal anomalies, are particularly vulnerable.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Temperature Anomalies (TSA):</strong> While short-term spikes in temperature contribute to bleaching, <strong>sustained temperature anomalies (SSTA and TSA)</strong> are more impactful. Areas experiencing frequent and prolonged thermal stress, such as parts of the <strong>Red Sea</strong> and <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, face severe bleaching.</li>\n",

    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Proximity to Shore:</strong> Reefs located <strong>close to shore</strong> face higher stress from human activities like pollution and runoff. Nearshore reefs in regions such as the <strong>Caribbean</strong> and <strong>Southeast Asia</strong> tend to have higher turbidity and are more exposed to bleaching, though deeper offshore reefs can also experience bleaching when exposed to thermal stress.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Turbidity:</strong> Higher turbidity levels, especially nearshore, reduce light penetration, limiting photosynthesis and increasing coral stress. However, moderate turbidity can sometimes provide slight protective effects by reducing direct solar exposure.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Cyclones and Windspeed:</strong> Cyclones and moderate windspeed provide a <strong>dual effect</strong>‚Äîcooling the waters and potentially reducing thermal stress while also increasing physical damage to reefs. Very high cyclone frequencies (>80) and moderate winds (5-12 m/s) exacerbate bleaching risks, especially in regions like the <strong>Caribbean</strong> and <strong>Indian Ocean</strong>.</li>\n",

    "        <li><strong>Exposure to Environmental Factors:</strong> Reefs that are <strong>sometimes exposed</strong> to environmental factors experience the highest bleaching severity, suggesting that fluctuating exposure levels can induce stress. <strong>Sheltered reefs</strong> tend to have lower bleaching severity, likely due to protection from strong currents and waves.</li>\n",

    "        <li><strong>Resilience in Cooler Regions:</strong> Coral reefs in <strong>cooler regions</strong> like the <strong>central Pacific</strong> and some parts of the <strong>Atlantic</strong> show lower bleaching severity, suggesting higher resilience due to less frequent exposure to extreme thermal events.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Vulnerability of Shallow Coral Sites:</strong> Shallow reefs, especially in the <strong>Caribbean</strong> and <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, are more vulnerable to <strong>thermal stress</strong> and <strong>human interference</strong>, making them critical zones for targeted conservation efforts.</li>\n",

    "After completing the data preprocessing, the next critical step is selecting appropriate regression models to predict our target variable, **Percent Bleaching**. We have chosen a diverse set of regression models that represent both linear and non-linear relationships, simple and complex architectures, and models that incorporate regularization and ensemble techniques to reduce overfitting and improve predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Why These Models?***\n",
    "\n",
    "We have selected a range of models to evaluate, each offering unique strengths for different types of data and prediction tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ridge Regression**: A linear regression model with L2 regularization. It helps prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients, particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity or high-dimensional data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Elastic Net Regression**: A hybrid of Ridge and Lasso regression, combining L1 and L2 regularization to balance between penalizing large coefficients and feature selection, making it effective in high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. This model reduces overfitting while capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. It‚Äôs robust to noise and effective on both small and large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradient Boosting Regression**: An advanced ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous one. This powerful approach is especially good for capturing complex patterns in data and is often used in predictive modeling competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A non-linear model that uses kernel tricks to handle complex relationships between features and the target variable. SVR is ideal for smaller datasets where precise decision boundaries are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **XGBoost Regression**: A highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. Known for its performance and speed, XGBoost is widely used in machine learning competitions and handles large datasets with complex features effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Decision Tree Regression**: A simple, interpretable model that splits data based on feature values. It is suitable for modeling non-linear relationships and interactions between variables but can overfit without proper tuning, hence included with limited depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LightGBM Regressor**: A gradient boosting framework that uses a leaf-wise tree growth algorithm, which makes it faster and more memory-efficient than traditional gradient boosting. It‚Äôs well-suited for large datasets and provides excellent performance with less training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **CatBoost Regressor**: A gradient boosting model specifically designed for categorical features, providing automatic handling of categorical variables without explicit encoding. It's fast, robust, and highly effective for structured datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **AdaBoost Regressor**: Another ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong model. It assigns higher weights to incorrectly predicted observations in subsequent rounds, helping to improve overall prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating this diverse set of models, we aim to identify the one that delivers the best balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency for predicting **Percent Bleaching**. We expect different models to perform better depending on the complexity of relationships within the dataset. This approach allows us to compare linear, regularized, non-linear, and ensemble models to ensure we capture both simple and complex patterns in the data.\n"

Cross-validation is a robust method for assessing how well models generalize to unseen data. In this section, we use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate each model across multiple scoring metrics. Here‚Äôs an overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**:  \n",
    "   To evaluate the models, we use a range of metrics:\n",
    "   - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.\n",
    "   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The square root of MSE, which provides an interpretable metric in the original unit of the target variable.\n",
    "   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, providing another view of prediction accuracy.\n",
    "   - **R¬≤ Score**: Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that the model explains. Higher values are better, with a value of 1 indicating perfect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation Process**:  \n",
    "   The function `cross_validate_model` performs cross-validation for each model, calculating the mean and standard deviation of the scoring metrics. Negative errors (MSE, MAE, MAPE) are negated to convert them back to positive values for interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**:  \n",
    "   The `tqdm` library is used to visually track progress as the cross-validation loop evaluates each model. After completing the evaluations, the results are stored in a DataFrame for easy comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Analysis**:  \n",
    "   The models are ranked based on their **R¬≤ Score**, which helps identify the best-performing model. A summary of performance metrics, including MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, is provided for each model. Finally, the best model is printed along with its associated metrics.\n",

    "We begin with **Random Search** for hyperparameter tuning because it is a simple and efficient method to explore a wide range of hyperparameters without the computational cost of exhaustive search methods. Random Search samples random combinations of hyperparameters, making it faster than grid search, especially when the parameter space is large. It provides a good starting point to quickly narrow down promising ranges for further, more refined tuning methods like **Bayesian Optimization**, which will be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "1. **n_estimators**: We first search for the optimal number of trees (`n_estimators`). More trees generally improve model performance, but with diminishing returns. Setting a range from 100 to 1500 trees ensures we explore both smaller, faster models and larger, more accurate ones. Random Search helps identify how many trees are sufficient before performance plateaus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **max_depth** and **min_samples_split**: Once the number of trees is chosen, we fine-tune the depth of each tree (`max_depth`) and the minimum number of samples required to split a node (`min_samples_split`). A deeper tree might overfit the data, so we explore different depths, including no limit (`None`). Varying the `min_samples_split` between 2, 5, and 10 helps prevent overly specific splits, ensuring the model generalizes better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **min_samples_leaf** and **max_features**: After determining the best tree structure, we adjust the minimum number of samples at each leaf (`min_samples_leaf`). This helps avoid overfitting small subsets of the data. We also adjust `max_features` to control the number of features considered at each split, allowing us to explore both more complex models (`auto`) and more constrained ones (`sqrt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **bootstrap**: Lastly, we explore whether using bootstrapped samples improves model performance. Bootstrap sampling is a feature of random forests that allows each tree to train on a slightly different dataset, improving robustness. We search between `True` and `False` to test its effectiveness in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Why these Hyperparameter Ranges?***\n",
    "- **n_estimators**: Set between 100 and 1500, providing a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy. While fewer trees may lead to underfitting, more than 1500 often shows diminishing returns.\n",
    "- **max_depth**: Ranges from 10, 20, 30, to `None` (unlimited). Limiting depth prevents overfitting, while `None` allows the model to learn more detailed relationships if necessary.\n",
    "- **min_samples_split**: Set between 2, 5, and 10. Higher values ensure nodes don‚Äôt split unless there‚Äôs sufficient data, preventing overfitting on small samples.\n",
    "- **min_samples_leaf**: Ranges from 1 to 4, limiting the minimum number of samples at each leaf. This prevents deep trees from being overly fine-tuned to small subsets.\n",
    "- **max_features**: Set to `auto` (use all features) or `sqrt` (square root of features), ensuring a balance between computational complexity and model diversity at each split.\n",
    "- **bootstrap**: Explores both `True` (with replacement) and `False` (without replacement), determining whether sampling with replacement improves model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of hyperparameters is well-suited for Random Forests, allowing us to explore tree-based model flexibility while controlling for overfitting and computational costs."

Instead of sampling hyperparameters randomly, it builds a probabilistic model of the objective function (in this case, the model performance) and uses this model to guide the search towards regions of the hyperparameter space that are more likely to yield improvements. This makes it more efficient and likely to find better hyperparameters in fewer iterations, especially when dealing with complex models like Random Forest.\n",

    "- BayesSearchCV is used to optimize the model‚Äôs performance over 32 iterations, utilizing a 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate different hyperparameter combinations.\n",

    "**Comparisons**:\n",
    "1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**:\n",
    "   - **Initial Model**: The base model starts with an MSE of **0.0646**.\n",
    "   - **Random Search**: Random Search tuning significantly reduces the MSE to **0.0513**, indicating that the tuned model makes fewer errors on average.\n",
    "   - **Bayesian Search**: Further refinement with Bayesian Search brings the MSE down to **0.0503**, showcasing a slight improvement over Random Search. This suggests Bayesian Optimization finds more optimal hyperparameters, though the gain is incremental.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**:\n",
    "   - **Initial Model**: The initial model has an RMSE of **0.2541**.\n",
    "   - **Random Search**: With Random Search, the RMSE drops to **0.2265**, showing an improvement in the model‚Äôs accuracy by lowering the prediction error.\n",
    "   - **Bayesian Search**: Bayesian Search continues this trend, reducing the RMSE further to **0.2242**, highlighting marginal gains in error reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:\n",
    "   - **Initial Model**: The MAE starts at **0.1872** in the initial model.\n",
    "   - **Random Search**: After Random Search, the MAE decreases to **0.1571**, meaning the average prediction error has become notably smaller.\n",
    "   - **Bayesian Search**: The best improvement is seen with Bayesian Search, achieving an MAE of **0.1483**, reflecting a more significant reduction in average absolute errors, which indicates better model accuracy and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **R¬≤ Score**:\n",
    "   - **Initial Model**: The R¬≤ Score is **0.7444**, indicating that the initial model explains about 74.44% of the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "   - **Random Search**: With hyperparameter tuning via Random Search, the R¬≤ Score increases to **0.7966**, showing the model can now explain almost 80% of the variance.\n",
    "   - **Bayesian Search**: The best result comes from Bayesian Search, with an R¬≤ Score of **0.8007**, indicating that the model now explains a little over 80% of the variance. This represents a substantial improvement in the model‚Äôs overall explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "- Both Random Search and Bayesian Search improved model performance, but Bayesian Search, as expected, yielded better results overall, albeit with smaller incremental gains compared to Random Search.\n",
    "- **Bayesian Search** refines the model further after Random Search has identified promising hyperparameter ranges, allowing for more fine-tuning and optimization.\n",
    "- The largest improvement is seen in **MAE**, where Bayesian Search reduces the average prediction error more effectively than Random Search.\n",
    "- **MSE** and **RMSE** show consistent improvements with both search methods, reflecting better model accuracy and a reduction in prediction variance.\n",
    "- **R¬≤ Score** shows that both Random Search and Bayesian Search significantly improve the model‚Äôs ability to explain the variance in coral bleaching outcomes, with Bayesian Search crossing the 80% threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "While Random Search offers a quick and substantial improvement over the initial model, **Bayesian Search** fine-tunes the hyperparameters to maximize performance, resulting in a more accurate and reliable model. Thus, Bayesian Search should be preferred for final model selection, as it yields the best overall performance across all key metrics.\n"
